# ASUS ZENBOOK HACKINTOSH
Clover hotpatches and tools for the Asus Zenbook laptop on macOS 10.13.6.

## Supported models

- UX410 (KabyLake)
- UX430 (KabyLake)
- UX430 (KabyLake-R)

* To add support for your laptop, please provide full specs and original ACPI files from Clover.

## What's working now
- Trackpad has some minor bugs (random cursor jumping, etc.), but gestures are great
- Wifi/Bluetooth: replace with DW1560. Stock Intel card will never work
- Everything else works well
